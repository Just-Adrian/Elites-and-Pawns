## ⚠️ IN PROGRESS / NEEDS FIXING

### **UI System (Partially Implemented)**
- ✅ PlayerHUD script created (health + ammo display)
- ✅ LocalPlayerCanvas script created
- ✅ Scripts compile without errors
- ❌ **UI not displaying in-game** ← NEEDS DEBUGGING

**UI Hierarchy Created:**
```
Player
└── PlayerHUD_Canvas (Canvas)
    ├── HealthPanel
    │   ├── HealthBar_Background (Image)
    │   │   └── HealthBar_Fill (Image - Type: Filled)
    │   └── HealthText (Text)
    │
    └── AmmoPanel
        ├── WeaponNameText (Text)
        └── AmmoText (Text)
```

**Components on PlayerHUD_Canvas:**
- Canvas (configured)
- LocalPlayerCanvas (added)
- PlayerHUD (added, references assigned)

**Issue:** UI elements not visible in-game despite proper setup

---

## 📋 KNOWN ISSUES

1. **UI Not Showing**
   - Symptoms: No health or ammo display visible when playing
   - Console: No errors, PlayerHUD initializes successfully
   - Likely causes: Canvas not enabling, UI off-screen, references not set

2. **"Tag: Head is not defined" Warning**
   - Non-critical warning
   - Fix: Create "Head" tag in Edit → Project Settings → Tags & Layers

3. **Client Joining May Not Have Weapon**
   - WeaponManager has coroutine to wait for camera
   - Should be fixed but needs testing with second client
