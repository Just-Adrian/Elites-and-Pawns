**Date**: October 26-28, 2025  
**Session Duration**: 2 days  
**Status**: ✅ **MILESTONE 1 COMPLETE**

## 🏆 Major Achievement: Working Multiplayer!

We have successfully implemented a **fully functional multiplayer FPS foundation** using Mirror Networking. Two players can now connect, move independently, and see each other in real-time!

---

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### 1. Core Systems Implementation

#### **Networking Systems** (~300 lines)
- ✅ `ElitesNetworkManager.cs` - Custom network manager
  - Server-authoritative architecture
  - Faction assignment system
  - Player connection/disconnection handling
  - Team balancing logic (ready for 3 factions)
  
- ✅ `NetworkPlayer.cs` - Player network identity
  - SyncVar synchronization
  - Faction color coding (Blue for MVP)
  - Player name synchronization
  - Network spawn handling

#### **Player Systems** (~400 lines)
- ✅ `PlayerController.cs` - First-person movement
  - WASD movement with sprint (Left Shift)
  - Mouse look with cursor lock/unlock
  - Jumping with proper ground detection
  - Fixed gravity accumulation bug
  - Character Controller based (optimal for FPS)
  
- ✅ `PlayerHealth.cs` - Health system
  - Server-authoritative damage
  - Death and respawn with delay
  - Network-synchronized health
  - Event system for UI integration

### 2. Unity Scene Setup

#### **NetworkTest Scene**
- ✅ Ground plane (20x1x20 scale)

- ✅ Blue faction coloring

### 3. Bug Fixes & Improvements

**Issues Resolved:**
1. ✅ Assembly definition file created for proper compilation
2. ✅ Missing namespace references fixed (PlayerHealth → NetworkPlayer)
3. ✅ Input System compatibility (set to "Both")
4. ✅ Ground detection improved (sphere check + CharacterController.isGrounded)
5. ✅ Gravity accumulation bug fixed (velocity reset when grounded)
6. ✅ Jump detection working properly

### 4. Documentation Created

- ✅ **GDD.md** (70+ pages) - Complete game design document
- ✅ **TDD.md** (100+ pages) - Technical design document  
- ✅ **MIRROR_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step Unity configuration
- ✅ **MILESTONE_1_PROGRESS.md** - Progress tracker
- ✅ **WORKFLOW.md** - Development workflow guide
- ✅ **ROADMAP.md** - Development phases

---

## 📊 Statistics

**Code Written:**
- **~900 lines** of production C# code
- **7 core scripts** fully implemented
- **100% documented** with XML comments

- ✅ No gravity bugs

### Multiplayer (2 Players)
- ✅ Host can start server
- ✅ Client can connect
- ✅ Both players visible to each other
- ✅ Movement synchronized in real-time
- ✅ Both players are blue (MVP faction)
- ✅ No critical lag or desync

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

### Networking
- **Mirror Networking** - Chosen for reliability and community support
- **Server-Authoritative** - All gameplay logic on server (anti-cheat ready)
- **KCP Transport** - Reliable UDP with congestion control
- **SyncVars** - For state synchronization (health, faction, name)

### Movement
- **CharacterController** over Rigidbody - More predictable for FPS
- **Legacy Input** for MVP - Will upgrade to Input System later
- **Ground Detection** - Dual check (CharacterController + Sphere cast)

### Architecture
- **Namespace Organization** - ElitesAndPawns.Core/Networking/Player
- **Assembly Definition** - Proper dependency management with Mirror
- **Singleton Pattern** - For managers (GameManager, etc.)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues (Minor)

1. **No spawn points configured** - Players spawn at origin (0,0,0)
   - Not critical for MVP
   - Will add in Milestone 2

2. **No shooting mechanics yet** - Coming in next phase
   - Planned for Milestone 1.5

3. **No UI** - No health bar, ammo counter, crosshair
   - Planned for Milestone 1.5

4. **Single faction only** - Only Blue faction implemented
   - RED and GREEN coming in Milestone 3

---
