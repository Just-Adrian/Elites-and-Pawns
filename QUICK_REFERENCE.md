## 🔍 QUICK HUD FIX

**Try this first:**

1. Canvas → Render Mode → **Screen Space - Overlay**
2. Remove LocalPlayerCanvas component
3. HealthText → Font Size: 72, Color: Red
4. Position HealthText at (0, 0)
5. Test

If red text appears = victory! Make it smaller and white.

## 📊 EXPECTED CONSOLE

```

```

```

```

## 🚀 SUCCESS = SEE THIS
