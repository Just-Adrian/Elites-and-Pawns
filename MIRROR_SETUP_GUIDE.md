#### 2D: Create Prefab

1. Create folder: `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/Player`
2. Drag **Player** from Hierarchy ‚Üí into `Prefabs/Player` folder
3. You now have a **Player.prefab**
4. **Delete Player from Hierarchy** (we only need the prefab)

---

### Step 3: Assign Player Prefab to Network Manager

   - Click **Start Host** button
3. **Expected Result**:
   - You spawn as a blue capsule
   - WASD to move
   - Mouse to look around
   - Spacebar to jump
   - Console shows debug messages

### Test 2: Multiplayer (Two Instances)

#### Option A: ParrelSync (Recommended)
1. Install ParrelSync from Package Manager (GitHub URL)
2. Create a clone project
3. Open both projects
4. In main project: **Start Host**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Can't find ElitesNetworkManager"
- Close and reopen Unity (refresh scripts)

- Check Ground Layer in PlayerController

### Camera Not Working
- Make sure PlayerCamera is disabled on the prefab
- Check that Camera Transform is assigned in PlayerController

### Players Don't See Each Other
