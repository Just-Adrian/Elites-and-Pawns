## üß™ Testing Checklist

Once Unity setup is complete, test:

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Start Host works
- [ ] Player spawns at spawn point
- [ ] Player is blue capsule
- [ ] WASD moves player
- [ ] Mouse rotates camera
- [ ] Spacebar makes player jump
- [ ] Console shows debug messages

### Multiplayer Functionality
- [ ] Start Client works (second instance)
- [ ] Both players see each other
- [ ] Both players have correct colors
- [ ] Movement synchronized in real-time
- [ ] No lag or stuttering (<100ms)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Player can't move through ground
- [ ] Player can't move through other players
- [ ] Disconnecting player removes from game
- [ ] Reconnecting player spawns correctly

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Investment

**Code Development**: ~2 hours  
**Documentation**: ~1 hour  
**Unity Setup** (your task): ~20 minutes  
**Testing**: ~10 minutes  

**Total to Working Multiplayer**: ~3.5 hours

---

## üéì Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **Mirror Networking**
   - Server-authoritative for security
   - KCP Transport for reliability
   - SyncVars for state synchronization

2. **CharacterController over Rigidbody**
   - More predictable for FPS
   - Better network performance
   - Easier to control

3. **First-Person Camera**
   - Camera attached to player
   - Disabled by default, enabled for local player
   - Smooth mouse look with clamping

4. **Faction System Ready**
   - Color-coded players
   - Server assigns factions
   - Ready for RED/GREEN expansion

5. **Debug Mode Throughout**
   - Every component logs actions
   - Easy to troubleshoot
   - Can disable for production

## üí° Pro Tips for Unity Setup

1. **Save Often**: Save scene after each step
2. **Test Incrementally**: Test after each major step
3. **Check Console**: Watch for errors/warnings
4. **Use Debug Mode**: Keep debug flags enabled for now
5. **ParrelSync**: Install this for easy multiplayer testing

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "Type or namespace 'Mirror' could not be found"  
**Solution**: Make sure Mirror package is properly installed, restart Unity

**Issue**: Player falls through ground  
**Solution**: Make sure Ground has a collider, check layers

**Issue**: Can't see other player  
**Solution**: Make sure Network Identity and Network Transform are on prefab

**Issue**: Movement feels sluggish  
**Solution**: Check that only local player processes input (isLocalPlayer check)

**Issue**: Camera rotates for all players  
**Solution**: Make sure camera transform is only enabled for local player

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done (Milestone 1)

Milestone 1 is complete when:
- [ ] Two players can connect (Host + Client)
- [ ] Both players spawn as blue capsules
- [ ] Both players can move independently (WASD)
- [ ] Both players can look around (Mouse)
- [ ] Both players can jump (Spacebar)
- [ ] Both players see each other moving in real-time
- [ ] No critical bugs or crashes
- [ ] Console debug logs confirm network sync

---

**Current Status**: ‚è≥ Awaiting Unity setup  
**Blocker**: Need Unity scene configuration (your task)  
**ETA to Completion**: 20-30 minutes after you start setup  

**You have all the code!** Now it's Unity configuration time. Follow the MIRROR_SETUP_GUIDE.md step-by-step! üéÆ
