# Milestone 1 Progress - Network Foundation

## ✅ Completed (Just Now!)

### 1. Project Structure Created
```
Assets/_Project/
├── Scripts/
│   ├── Core/
│   │   ├── GameEnums.cs ✅
│   │   ├── Singleton.cs ✅
│   │   └── GameManager.cs ✅
│   ├── Networking/ (created, awaiting Mirror)
│   └── Player/ (created, awaiting Mirror)
├── Scenes/ (created)
└── Prefabs/ (created)
```

### 2. Core Scripts Written

#### GameEnums.cs
- **FactionType**: Blue, Red, Green
- **GameState**: MainMenu, WarMapView, InBattle, etc.
- **NodeType**: MajorCity, ResourcePoint, etc.
- **GameMode**: ControlPoints (MVP), etc.

#### Singleton.cs
- Generic singleton pattern for managers
- Thread-safe
- Persists across scenes
- Auto-cleanup on destroy

#### GameManager.cs
- Central game state management
- Scene transition handling
- Faction selection
- Debug mode support
- Event system for state changes

### 3. Test Scene Created
- **NetworkTest.unity** in `Assets/_Project/Scenes/`
- Ground plane (20x1x20) for testing
- Ready for adding player and networking components

## ⏳ Next Steps (Waiting on You)

### Step 1: Install Mirror Networking
**You need to do this manually:**

1. Open **Unity Editor**
2. Go to **Window → Package Manager**
3. Click **+ (top-left)** → **Add package from git URL**
4. Enter: `https://github.com/MirrorNetworking/Mirror.git`
5. Click **Add**
6. Wait for installation to complete

**Alternative:** Download from Asset Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321

### Step 2: Tell Me When Mirror is Installed
Once Mirror is installed, I'll create:
- NetworkManager setup
- Player prefab with movement
- Basic multiplayer synchronization
- Network spawning

## 🎯 What You Should See in Unity

1. **Project window**: New `_Project` folder in Assets
2. **Scripts**: Three C# files in `_Project/Scripts/Core/`
3. **Scene**: NetworkTest.unity in `_Project/Scenes/`
4. **Scene view**: Large gray ground plane

---

## 🔍 How to Test What We Have So Far

1. Open Unity
2. Navigate to `Assets/_Project/Scenes/NetworkTest`
3. Double-click to open the scene
4. You should see a large ground plane
5. Look in the Hierarchy - you should see "Ground" cube

---

## 💻 Code We've Written (So Far)

- **~200 lines** of well-documented C# code
- Full namespace organization (`ElitesAndPawns.Core`)
- XML documentation comments on all public methods
- Follows Unity best practices
- Ready for networking integration

---

## 🚀 What Happens After Mirror is Installed

I'll immediately create:

1. **ElitesNetworkManager.cs**
   - Handles player connections
   - Spawns players
   - Manages sessions

2. **NetworkPlayer.cs**
   - Player network identity
   - Synchronization setup

3. **PlayerController.cs**
   - WASD movement
   - Jumping
   - Camera control

4. **PlayerPrefab**
   - Complete player with all components
   - Network-ready

Then we can test multiplayer with 2 Unity Editor instances!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- All scripts use proper namespaces
- Singleton pattern ensures single instances
- GameManager persists across scenes (DontDestroyOnLoad)
- Debug mode enabled for testing
- Ready for Mirror integration

---

**STATUS**: Waiting for Mirror installation to continue  
**ETA**: ~30 minutes after Mirror installed to complete Milestone 1  
**Next Deliverable**: Two players can join, move, and see each other
