# Weapon System - Projectile Redesign Summary

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Change**: Hitscan → Projectile-based

---

## What Changed

### **Removed**
- ❌ `HitscanWeapon.cs` - Instant raycast shooting (DELETE THIS FILE)

### **Added**
- ✅ `Projectile.cs` - Physics-based bullet with travel time and drop
- ✅ `ProjectileWeapon.cs` - Spawns physical projectiles

### **Updated**
- 🔄 `WeaponData.cs` - Added projectile physics properties
- 🔄 `BaseWeapon.cs` - Unchanged (still compatible)
- 🔄 `WeaponManager.cs` - Unchanged (weapon-agnostic)
- 🔄 `PlayerHealth.cs` - Unchanged (works with projectiles)

---

## Why Projectile-Based?

**Better long-range engagement:**
- Lead moving targets (skill)
- Bullet drop (realism)
- Visible projectiles (tactical awareness)
- Travel time (positioning matters)
- Natural damage falloff

**VS Hitscan:**
- Hitscan = instant hit = boring at range
- Projectile = requires aim prediction = engaging

## Quick Setup

1. **Delete old file**: `HitscanWeapon.cs` (no longer used)
2. **Create projectile prefab**: Rigidbody + Collider + Projectile script
3. **Update weapon data**: Add projectile speed, gravity, lifetime
4. **Use ProjectileWeapon**: Instead of HitscanWeapon on player
5. **Configure layers**: Projectile layer for collision filtering

See **WEAPON_SYSTEM_SETUP.md** for full instructions.

## File Cleanup Needed

**Please delete manually:**
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Weapons/HitscanWeapon.cs`
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Weapons/HitscanWeapon.cs.meta`

(I cannot delete files, but they're no longer used)

## Benefits of New System

✅ **More engaging** - Skill-based long-range combat  
✅ **More tactical** - Projectile travel time adds strategy  
✅ **More realistic** - Bullet physics (drop, travel time)  
✅ **More visible** - See tracers, dodge projectiles  
✅ **Scalable** - Easy to add rockets, grenades, etc.
